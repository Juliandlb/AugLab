# AugLab - Interactive Augmentation Playground

An interactive tool for applying and experimenting with image augmentations on robot perception data.

## Features

- Upload and view images, videos, or JSONL files
- Interactive real-time augmentation controls (all in one panel):
  - Image flipping (horizontal/vertical)
  - Rotation (-45Â° to 45Â°)
  - Brightness adjustment (0.5x to 2.0x)
  - Contrast adjustment (0.5x to 2.0x)
  - **Blur** (Gaussian blur, kernel size 0â€“10)
  - **Color jitter**:
    - Hue shift (-90Â° to 90Â°)
    - Saturation adjustment (0.0x to 2.0x)
  - **Occlusion** (random rectangle patch, size 0â€“0.5 ratio)
- Live preview of augmented data with synchronized frame navigation
- Smart, actionable augmentation recommendations based on image analysis:
  - Only suggests available controls: blur, color jitter (hue/saturation), occlusion, brightness, contrast, sharpness
  - Context-aware advice (e.g., "Apply Blur to reduce sharpness", "Increase color vibrancy using Saturation slider")
  - Brightness, contrast, sharpness, and saturation suggestions
- Export augmented data and configurations (coming soon)

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Current Status

- âœ… Basic UI implementation with Gradio
- âœ… Real-time augmentation controls (full set)
- âœ… Frame navigation with synchronized previews
- âœ… Support for multiple file formats (images, videos, JSONL)
- âœ… Smart recommendations based on image analysis
- ðŸ”„ Export functionality (in development)

## Image Analysis Features

The application analyzes images in real-time to provide actionable, context-aware augmentation recommendations. Only implemented augmentations are suggested:

- **Brightness Analysis**: Detects if images are too dark or too bright
- **Contrast Analysis**: Measures image contrast and suggests adjustments
- **Sharpness Detection**: Identifies blurry images and suggests improvements
- **Saturation Analysis**: For color images, suggests saturation adjustments
- **Entropy Calculation**: Measures image information content
